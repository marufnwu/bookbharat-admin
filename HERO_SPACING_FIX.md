# Hero Section Spacing Fix

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Hero sections taking too much vertical space  
**Status:** âœ… FIXED

---

## Problem

All 11 hero section variants were using excessive vertical spacing:
- `min-h-[50vh]` / `min-h-[60vh]` - 50-60% of viewport height
- `py-8 md:py-12` / `py-8 md:py-10 lg:py-12` - Large padding

This caused:
- Hero taking up entire screen on mobile
- Users had to scroll excessively
- Poor content hierarchy
- Wasted screen real estate

---

## Solution

Reduced vertical spacing across all variants:

### Before:
```css
min-h-[50vh] md:min-h-[60vh]  /* 50-60% viewport height */
py-8 md:py-12                  /* 32px-48px padding */
py-8 md:py-10 lg:py-12         /* 32px-48px padding */
```

### After:
```css
/* Removed min-h constraints - content-driven height */
py-4 md:py-6                   /* 16px-24px padding */
py-6 md:py-8                   /* 24px-32px padding */
```
